# **Open-Food-Fact-API-Use**

## *Introduction*

"Open Classroom" Project nÂ°5 for Python Application Developer formation.
The goal behind this  project is to request data's from an API and use them to create a database as resource for a simple application.

User of the application can choose a food category, then a product of that category and expect the application to provide a more healthy substitute if any exists in the database.
Sustitute comes along with usefull informations (if they exist) such as:
* Description.
* Stores where it can be purchased.
* URL to product's page on Open Food Facts

The application is expected to record previous searches as well for rapid further access.

* Controler :
  * Verifies User inputs
  * Handles Model's interactions with local database
  * Hands Model's informations to View

* Model :
  * Gets datas from Open Food Facts API
  * Cleans datas collected
  * Builds Tables in local database
  * Sends data to local database
  * Retrieves datas from local database
  * Finds substitute

* View :
  * Displays user Interface 
  * Displays application responses

* Config : Constants used in other modules for easy access

## *Requirements*

To use the application properly, you need to have python and mysql installed on your PC.
You also need to have the modules "requests" and "mysql.connector" for python.
